<p>As said in the header, MekCraft is a Minecraft server based around Mekanism; By "based" i mean it is just a main mod that i chose, for currency, mekanism osmium/obsidian ingots are the official server currency (i use physical minecraft money (not literally)). This does not stop you from using other things from any installed mod as trading currency, just that it wont be accepted when trading at a 1 person trading booth, which is trading with a ME network. There is a 2nd server which is creative, you have to find hints about it's IP address, which i will scatter around the spawn area (300x300x300), you spawn 5 blocks from spawn border, with a signal disruptor (to stop people from spawnkilling you), 1 torch, and 20 glass.</p> <b>
